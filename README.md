# School Agenda for people in BZZ

**What is this website**
<br>
It's a digital agenda for people in BZZ (happy Tim?). You can keep track of your homework, tests, grades etc...
You will have to add your own subjects so that it's not my fault if one is missing :P<br>
I like the grade page because it keeps your average grades up to date and you don't have to calculate it yourself


**Functions**
<br>
*What you do:*
- Add subjects (say if its on Monday or Tuesday)
- Add homework
- Add tests
- Say if you've completed homework/tests
- Enter your grade in a finished test

*Automatically done:*
- Average of grades for each subject is calculated
- Incomplete Homework will be shown on the home page
- Upcoming tests will also be shown on the home page
